My name is Bart≈Çomiej Dach.
My journey with programming started when I picked up a short book detailing the basics of C++ around 2005.
For quite a while my coding skills were rather meagre --- before enrolling into university the best I could do is make a simple clone of Hangman in Visual Basic *(shudder)* --- but I was almost immediately certain that I wanted to learn how to create and maintain software.
 
Since then, I've finished my bachelor's degree, completed several university projects and dabbled in probably a dozen programming languages.
But the desire to program has remained through and through, and I still find myself pulling late-nighters to create things I consider interesting.
My private obsession is to find not just any solution to the problem at hand, but to try to identify the best possible one.
Unfortunately, this has turned out to be a grueling process, ultimately requiring trial and error.

The goal for this blog is to find topics that interest me, and to describe my thought process during the development of a solution.
The aim of such a description is two-fold:

* By having to explain my decisions, I hope to become a better programmer by putting them out there and assessing the feedback.
* I am also hoping to inspire other people to pick up or continue programming --- to "ignite the spark" in others.

Now that we've got the introduction out of the way --- let's see where this goes!
